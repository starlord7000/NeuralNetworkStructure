![Python Logo](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo.png "Sample inline image")

A sample project that exists as an aid to the [Python Packaging User
Guide][packaging guide]'s [Tutorial on Packaging and Distributing
Projects][distribution tutorial].

This project does not aim to cover best practices for Python project
development as a whole. For example, it does not provide guidance or tool
recommendations for version control, documentation, or testing.

[The source for this project is available here][src].

The metadata for a Python project is defined in the `pyproject.toml` file,
an example of which is included in this project. You should edit this file
accordingly to adapt this sample project to your needs.

----

This is the README file for the project.

This project is a very simple class structure for a neural network.
